1. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, including water, juice, and broth. This can help keep your body hydrated and may help lower your temperature.

   It is important to follow the recommended dosage and not exceed it.

4. Treat the underlying cause: If your fever is caused by an underlying medical condition, it is important to treat that condition in order to overcome the fever.

In addition to these general tips, there are also some necessary precautions that can help prevent fever:
